'use strict'

// Look I don't know how you're supposed to test redux and sagas and shit and i started reading the docs on how to do it and realized i didnt realy know how redux worked anyways.
// So i'm just going to do whatever. In the process I"ll probably end up with an understanding of how sagas work and without an understanding of the configuration of a test framework. I'm okay with that.
